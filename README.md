## 🎯 Introduction
A brief overview of your project and its purpose. Mention which problem statement are your attempting to solve. Keep it concise and engaging.

The objective is to develop an Mulit-agent Agentic AI email classifier, that can efficiently identify the service request type from email content, subject, and attachments. The solution leverages Gemini (or alternative LLaMA models) integrated with LangChain to classify emails based on predefined rules and keyword patterns.
While Generative AI (like Gemini, GPT, and LLaMA) focuses on content creation based on prompts, Agentic AI introduces a more dynamic and autonomous decision-making framework.

Agentic AI can:

✅ Break down complex tasks into smaller steps.
✅ Strategically decide which tools, APIs, or functions to use.
✅ Adapt to changing conditions during runtime.
✅ Maintain context and learn from previous actions.

## 💡 Inspiration
What inspired you to create this project? Describe the problem you're solving.

Looking into the current challenges a bank as an organization faces, we observed that manually extracting content from email and classifying them into different categories is one of the tedious job a person has to do. Though the content might be different in terms of an email, but building a solution could also solve many such problems dealing with text classification.


## ⚙️ What It Does
Explain the key features and functionalities of your project.

The multi-agent AI architecture employed here follows a structured yet flexible design, where specialized agents are assigned distinct tasks. This method breaks down the email classification challenge into modular steps, improving accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.
Proposed solution uses agents performing:
	•  Input Extraction Agent (Content & Attachment Processor), Role: Extracts text from email bodies, attachments, and metadata
	•  Preprocessing Agent (Normalization & Cleaning), Role: Cleans and normalizes extracted text for consistency.
	• Classification Agent (Service Request Identifier), Role: Identifies the service request type based on content context.
	• Duplicate Detection Agent (Email Uniqueness Checker), Role: Prevents redundant email processing by identifying duplicates.
	• Confidence Scoring Agent (Trustworthiness Evaluator), Role: Assigns a confidence score to each classification based on content quality and keyword strength.
Output Aggregator Agent (Result Builder), Role: Consolidates outputs from all agents to deliver a structured result.
